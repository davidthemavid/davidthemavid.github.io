    <h2>My Journey to Development</h2>
    <p>
      I spent the last 4 years working in
      operations & training at a fast-paced startup called
      <a
        href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/bmw-wants-to-share-in-seattles-car-sharing-boom/"
        >EcoService</a
      >. We prepped, launched, and managed car-share fleets for AAA, BCAA, and
      BMW throughout North America.
    This was my first exposure to web
      development with our own properietary app used to track thousands of
      vehicles & their status, as well as to assign & report tasks.</p> Having witnessed the impact web development had on our company led me to pursuing web development myself. I enrolled in
      BrainStation's Full Time Web Development program, 
      graduating in December 2019. With my new found skills I look forward to bringing the same game-changing impact I witnessed, to other small businesses

    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>
    When not behind a computer, you can find me in nature: running the seawall, hiking, camping, or snowboarding. I also love watching movies, the Greenbay Packers, and trying out new beers at local craft breweries.</p>
