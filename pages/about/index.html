    <h2>Web Development Journey</h2>
    <p>
      I spent the last 4 years working in operations & training at a fast-paced
      startup called
      <a
        href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/bmw-wants-to-share-in-seattles-car-sharing-boom/"
        target="_blank"
        >EcoService</a
      >. We prepped, launched, and managed car-share fleets throughout North
      America for AAA, Avis, BCAA, and BMW. My first exposure to web development
      was with our own properietary app that allowed us to track, assign &
      report tasks on thousands of vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having witnessed the impact web development had on our company led me to
      pursuing web development myself. I enrolled in BrainStation's Full Time
      Web Development program, graduating in December 2019. With my new found
      skills I look forward to bringing the same game-changing impact I
      witnessed, to other small businesses.

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
      When not behind a computer, you can find me in nature: running the
      seawall, hiking, camping, or snowboarding. I also love watching movies,
      the Greenbay Packers, and trying out new beers at local craft breweries.
